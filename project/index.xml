<p>Having a website is cool. Hosting it on a custom domain name is cooler.</p>
<p>I want to use this website to:</p>
<ul>
<li>motivate myself to learn new things</li>
<li>improve my writing (and reading) skills</li>
<li>share my thoughts and ideas publicly on interesting technology topics</li>
</ul>
<p>Update: see <a href="/post/im-a-blogger-now">my first post</a> for more details on why I (re-)created this website.</p>
<h2 id="what">what?</h2>
<p>A website! Base requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow for N categories of content with templates</li>
<li>comments via GitHub</li>
<li>dark mode</li>
<li>RSS feed</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how">how?</h2>
<p>Source code: <a href="https://github.com/lostmygithubaccount/lostmygithubaccount.github.io">https://github.com/lostmygithubaccount/lostmygithubaccount.github.io</a>.</p>
<p>Static website defined and built by Hugo using the PaperMod theme. Hosted on GitHub Pages as my user page. CI/CD by GitHub Actions. Custom domain used with a CNAME record. Giscus for comments (embedded via Hugo shortcodes, which are cool).</p>
<h3 id="customization">customization</h3>
<p>The footer is customized slightly. The general pattern for customizing a theme is copying its layout over into your own <code>layouts/</code> and modifying them as needed.</p>
<p>I initially used a shortcode for adding &ldquo;Last updated&rdquo;, but this seemed prone to error. Fortunately I found <a href="https://www.jacksonlucky.net/posts/use-lastmod-with-papermod/">this post by some random retired judge</a> that showed me a better way! I probably could have figured this out on my own, but I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t have to. Little customizations like that can take a lot of time.</p>
<h2 id="learnings">learnings</h2>
<ul>
<li>GitHub pages are still a bit annoying</li>
<li>I need to stop restarting from scratch</li>
<li>I still really dislike front-end development</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m basically back in the same place as my last website attempt with slightly less custom code and slightly faster build times. I do like the theme a bit better and feel like I have a clearer grasp on the overall tech stack and limitations.</p>
<p>Hugo is nice compared to mkdocs and the Python families of static website frameworks and themes. Static vs dynamic can still be a blurry line with clever use of GitHub. Go&rsquo;s templating is interesting for other reasons. You probably still need to write a bit of HTML and JavaScript for anything custom, unfortunately. The Hugo shortcuts make this cleaner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly easy to fiddle with front-end elements and GUI considerations for hours without accomplishing anything meaningful.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get Hugo modules at first, once I realized they were Go modules (and how that&rsquo;d interact with themes) that made a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Most of the things I think of and lean toward (re)inventing I come to find out already exist as mature OSS on GitHub. Still, some customization or additional work is needed to fit it to my needs.</p>
<h3 id="future-ideas">future ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li>comment-based actions (delete comment, delete thread, post content, etc.)</li>
<li>proper categorization</li>
<li><del>automated last-updated-at info</del></li>
<li>search</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff I could do &ndash; I like having a place I can.</p>

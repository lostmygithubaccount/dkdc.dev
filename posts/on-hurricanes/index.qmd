Last week there was a disaster, and that disaster has a name.

## Hurricane Helene

On Friday, I woke up pleasantly surprised to find my power was on. Over 10% of my fellow Floridians -- more than a million people -- were not so fortunate. At least one was dead, with the total toll continuing to rise.

### Nothing to be done?

I took [Murphy](../murphy/index.qmd) and [Nix](../nix/index.qmd) on our usual walk to the dog park. Unusually, nobody else was there. Had they lost power? Had fallen trees blocked their driveways? Did they have to deal with damage to their cars? Their homes? I didn't know and, at least in some sense, did not care. I was happy my house was fine. A large branch almost landed on my car's windshield, but missed. It was like any other cloudy morning with a slight drizzle. Disaster and death happen all over the world every day and life goes on.

But it's not like I can't empathize with hurricane victims.

## Hurricane Harvey

Years ago, a different "H" hurricane hit Houston. I had driven back to Houston from Florida to start my senior year of college alongside my three housemates. We rented a unit in a duplex located between a convent and a cell phone tower. Houston is weird. Three of us had lived together in the same house the prior year, with the fourth housemate choosing to instead live with his girlfriend for their senior year. Our new fourth housemate was a friend of mine since freshman year, we'll call him Max.

Harvey approached Houston the first weekend of the semester. Flooding was expected. We were concerned about our cars. Max had parked his car in a friend's apartment complex's elevated parking garage, but it got towed as the edge of the hurricane moved over the city. This was annoying, but we were in it together from the beginning. The four of us all drove out to the tow yard in the early hours of the rain. We got Max's car back, he parked somewhere else, and we all returned to the house to ride out the storm together.

### Nothing to be done

The house quickly flooded. We moved everything we could to the second floor and elevated the one car still in the driveway. The power went out, but we made the most of it. We grilled, we ate, we drank, we played Monopoly, and we had a pretty good time overall.

Hurricane grilling.

After a few days, we made the decision to flee to campus. Campus had power and the floodwaters had somewhat receded. We hopped in the car and drove off. As we were nearing campus, the streets were still flooded and it was raining heavily. We saw two idiots wading through the storm toward campus with their suitcases. As we got closer, we realized they were our former fourth housemate and his girlfriend! We drove close by, splashing them with water and yelling insults as we passed.

Just kidding, they piled into the already crowded sedan with their additional luggage and we all made it to campus safely. I stayed in a former roommate's double, sleeping on their remarkably uncomfortable couch.

### The aftermath

We were all looking forward to our senior year in that house, but it wasn't looking great when the flooding fully receded and we were able to go back and take a look. A contractor estimating repairs summed it up as:

![FUCK!](fuck.png)

Fuck, indeed.

We initially did our best to help out with the repairs:

But over time reality set in. The final straw was a fairly conclusive mold test:

Our house was not livable. Our landlord disagreed, demanding we pay rent for the full year -- a small fortune to ask of poor college students who now had to find alternative housing. He yelled, threatened, threatened legal action, and left nasty texts and voicemails on my phone. Fortunately he only made idle threats -- he was not a serious person. Had he pursued anything, we had the support of each other and our community.

### The community

We were far from alone in our suffering. Many people in Houston and other areas were in similar, or far worse, situations as myself and my housemates. Many other students lost their housing too.

Efforts by communities were organized, including one to house displaced college students. One of my housemates was insistent on applying and within a few weeks we all moved in with a nice couple in a nice neighborhood near campus. Their younger daughter was a freshman at our college and their older daughter worked at Microsoft (foreshadowing!). While we still missed our house and were sad about the situation affecting our senior year, we were grateful for the help -- I was grateful to have a bed to sleep in again.

We also got to play with and help raise their adorable foster puppies (more foreshadowing!):

### Microsoft

I distinctly remember lying on that ***awful*** couch, reading the email from a Microsoft recruiter: I was invited for a final round interview loop in Redmond, WA. I had applied and interviewed for an internship the previous year, resulting in a "deferred" status -- not rejected, but they had run out of intetnships to give out and would reach out next year about opportunities. And they did!

While living with the nice couple, I was flown out to Seattle and stayed in a fancy hotel. I spent a day at the recruiting building on the main campus completing interviews with my future teammates and manager. It'd take some time to find out I had an offer -- I was still living with the nice couple -- but not too long after Hurricane Harvey seemingly upended my life, my future was secured. I had landed my dream job, working where I wanted to on what I wanted to.

### Murphy the dog

After some time with the nice couple, my housemates and I wanted to live on our own again. We ended up renting an apartment. It wasn't our house, but it was ours for the rest of our senior year.

With a job secured and my future situation clarified, I decided to adopt a dog. I went to the local shelter with a housemate (pictured above in the post-grill chillin' picture) and found Murphy. She was the most scared dog in the shelter, but I knew she was the one.

Murphy was rescued in Galveston, TX, likely displaced during Hurricane Harvey. She was clearly abused but has lived a happy (if not spoiled) life since adoption. She's been my best friend for approaching seven years.

## Horrors and hope ahead

Hurricanes are not fun. They are a bit funny. We give them names and can make accurate predictions about them. If you live in Florida, you're likely to experience one every year. We can predict when in the year they will happen and watch them from above as they are forming. We can then predict the path they will take and approximate expected damages and loss of life.

And then we do very little about them. While we cannot prevent hurricanes, we can prevent most of the damage they cause. Why don't we?

### Something to be done?

### Silver linings

On cloud days we can look for the silver linings. After Harvey, these included Microsoft and Murphy.

Additionally, I've been fortunate to have excellent communities around me at times of need. I could not be where I am today with my housemates, the nice couple, my friends, my family, and many others.

### What's next for me?

Life goes on. I spent some time preparing physically for losing power and mentally for a catastrophe. But for me, Hurricane Helene was just a rainy day. For others, it will have effects for months or even years to come. I hope they can find the support they need in their communities. I hope one day I am in a better position to help others myself. I hope we can all do better to prevent such disasters in the future.

I did get to see this cool bird at the dog park on Friday:

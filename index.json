[{"content":"why? Having a website is cool. Hosting it on a custom domain name is cooler.\nI want to use this website to:\nmotivate myself to learn new things improve my writing (and reading) skills share my thoughts and ideas publicly on interesting technology topics what? A website! Base requirements:\nallow for N categories of content with templates comments via GitHub dark mode RSS feed Future ideas:\ncomment-based actions (delete comment, delete thread, post content, etc.) proper categorization automated last-updated-at info search There\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of stuff I could do \u0026ndash; I like having a place I can.\nhow? Source code: https://github.com/lostmygithubaccount/lostmygithubaccount.github.io.\nStatic website defined and built by Hugo using the PaperMod theme. Hosted on GitHub Pages as my user page. CI/CD by GitHub Actions. Custom domain used with a CNAME record. Giscus for comments (embedded via Hugo shortcodes, which are cool).\nlearnings GitHub pages are still a bit annoying I need to stop restarting from scratch I still really dislike front-end development I\u0026rsquo;m basically back in the same place as my last website attempt with slightly less custom code and slightly faster build times. I do like the theme a bit better and feel like I have a clearer grasp on the overall tech stack and limitations.\nHugo is nice compared to mkdocs and the Python families of static website frameworks and themes. Static vs dynamic can still be a blurry line with clever use of GitHub. Go\u0026rsquo;s templating is interesting for other reasons. You probably still need to write a bit of HTML and JavaScript for anything custom, unfortunately. The Hugo shortcuts make this cleaner.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s incredibly easy to fiddle with front-end elements and GUI considerations for hours without accomplishing anything meaningful.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t get Hugo modules at first, once I realized they were Go modules (and how that\u0026rsquo;d interact with themes) that made a lot of sense.\nMost of the things I think of and lean toward (re)inventing I come to find out already exist as mature OSS on GitHub. Still, some customization or additional work is needed to fit it to my needs.\ncomments ","permalink":"https://dkdc.dev/project/website/","summary":"see the footer","title":"website"}]

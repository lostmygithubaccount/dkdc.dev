This year, I&rsquo;ve decided to become a blogger. This is not my first attempt at a first post or website, there have been a few iterations. But I am committing to this one without restarting again. My goal is to post every week, though I&rsquo;m already failing at that two weeks into the new year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll focus my content on cool technology and open-source software contributions, however small.</p>
<h2 id="the-beauty-of-oss">the beauty of OSS</h2>
<p>Developing code (and related content) in the open has a number of benefits including:</p>
<ul>
<li>public, easily discoverable, and easily shareable</li>
<li>competitive pressure to product quality work</li>
<li>coalescing around common standards</li>
</ul>
<p>dbt Labs calls this <a href="https://github.com/dbt-labs/corp/blob/main/values.md#we-contribute-to-the-knowledge-loop">contributing to the knowledge loop</a>, and it&rsquo;s certainly not a unique concept. Some other blogger <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-third-magic">calls this the first magic</a>. I&rsquo;ll call this learning.</p>
<p>By developing in the open and levering public communities, we can build a better platform for ourselves and future people to build on. This is the beauty of OSS.</p>
<h2 id="inspiration-and-aspiration">inspiration and aspiration</h2>
<p>There are clear inspirations. <a href="https://matthewrocklin.com/redesign-blog.html">Matthew Rocklin, creator of Dask, recently rethought his website and blog</a> with some interesting points. I found <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Tim">Tim Bray, a creator of XML, has an ongoing blog</a> including <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2013/06/16/Go-Love-Hate">posts on Go written before I learned how to code</a> relevant for my own learning. While figuring out how to add the &ldquo;last updated&rdquo; field for this website, I found <a href="https://www.jacksonlucky.net/posts/use-lastmod-with-papermod/">a retired judge who told me exactly how, on a similar site using the same theme</a>.</p>
<p>Great content is out there. Great communities are out there. Over time they are usually gamified and the quality decreases. I&rsquo;ve watched this trend unfold again on LinkedIn, which was and still is a source of useful content posted or amplified by a network of connected professionals &ndash; but is increasingly memes and other noise.</p>
<p>This <a href="/project/website">website</a> is my attempt to cut out noise and contribute learnings publicly.</p>

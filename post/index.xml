<p>Last year, I attempted to become a LinkedIn influencer. This year, I&rsquo;ve decided to become a blogger. This is not my first attempt at a first post or website, there have been a few iterations. But I am committing to this one without restarting again. My goal is to post every week, though I&rsquo;m already failing at that two weeks into the new year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll focus my content on cool technology and open-source software contributions, however small.</p>
<h2 id="the-beauty-of-oss">the beauty of OSS</h2>
<p>Developing code (and related content) in the open has a number of benefits including:</p>
<ul>
<li>public, easily discoverable, and easily shareable</li>
<li>competitive pressure to product quality work</li>
<li>coalescing around common standards</li>
</ul>
<p>dbt Labs calls this <a href="https://github.com/dbt-labs/corp/blob/main/values.md#we-contribute-to-the-knowledge-loop">contributing to the knowledge loop</a>, and it&rsquo;s certainly not a unique concept. Some other blogger <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-third-magic">calls this the first magic</a>. I&rsquo;ll call this learning.</p>
<p>By developing in the open and levering public communities, we can build a better platform for ourselves and future people to build on. This is the beauty of OSS.</p>
<h2 id="inspiration-and-aspiration">inspiration and aspiration</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not calling this a blog because I like to be a contrarian &ndash; this is just my website, and these are just my posts on it. I want to be intentional about what organization of content. Projects are high-effort, long-lived snapshots of something cool I did. Posts are low-effort, medium confidence knowledge sharing. Musings are high-effort, low-confidence knowledge sharing.</p>
<p>There are some clear inspirations. <a href="https://matthewrocklin.com/redesign-blog.html">Matthew Rocklin recently rethought his website and blog</a> with some interesting points. I found out <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing">Tim Bray, a creator of XML, has an ongoing blog</a> including <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2013/06/16/Go-Love-Hate">posts on Go written before I larned how to code</a> I&rsquo;ve found relevant for my own learning recently. While figuring out how to have the &ldquo;last updated&rdquo; field, I found <a href="https://www.jacksonlucky.net/posts/use-lastmod-with-papermod/">some random retired judge who told me exactly how with a similar site</a>.</p>
<p>Great content is out there. Great communities are out there. Unfortunately, over time they are usually gamified and the quality decreases. I&rsquo;ve watched this trend unfold again on LinkedIn, which was and still is a source of useful content posted or amplified by a network of connected professionals &ndash; but is increasingly memes and other noise. This website is my personal attempt to cut out noise without sacrificing.</p>

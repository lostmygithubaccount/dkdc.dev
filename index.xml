<h2 id="why">why?</h2>
<p>Having a website is cool. Hosting it on a custom domain name is cooler. Why dkdc.ai?</p>
<p>According to ChatGPT*:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that someone might want the domain name &ldquo;dkdc.ai&rdquo; because it reflects a casual or relaxed attitude, and they feel that it would be a good fit for their personal or business brand. The phrase &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know, don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; (often abbreviated as &ldquo;DKDC&rdquo;) is often used to express disinterest or apathy towards a particular subject or situation. It&rsquo;s possible that the owner of this domain name might want to convey a sense of ease or simplicity, or they might simply like the sound of the phrase.</p>
<p>There are many potential reasons why someone might choose a specific domain name, and the ultimate decision will depend on the individual&rsquo;s goals and preferences. It&rsquo;s also possible that the owner of &ldquo;dkdc.ai&rdquo; simply liked the way the domain name sounded and thought it would be memorable and easy to spell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to me**:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DKDC</p>

<p>I intend to use this website to:</p>
<ul>
<li>practice writing</li>
<li>practice coding</li>
<li>document projects</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what">what?</h2>
<p>A website!</p>
<p>Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub-powered commenting system</li>
<li>works for reading and writing on mobile</li>
<li>allows for posting content and media to RSS feeds</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="secret-roadmap">secret roadmap</h3>
<p>Use this website as motivation for learning some new languages and creating templates/tools for common automation. Document some past projects.</p>
<h2 id="how">how?</h2>
<p>Source code: <a href="https://github.com/lostmygithubaccount/lostmygithubaccount.github.io">https://github.com/lostmygithubaccount/lostmygithubaccount.github.io</a>.</p>
<p>Static website defined and built by Hugo using the PaperMod theme. Hosted on GitHub Pages as my user page. CI/CD by GitHub Actions. Custom domain used with a CNAME record.</p>
<h2 id="learnings">learnings</h2>
<ul>
<li>GitHub pages are still a bit annoying</li>
<li>I need to stop restarting from scratch</li>
<li>I still really dislike front-end development</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m basically back in the same place as my last website attempt with slightly less custom code and slightly faster build times. I do like the theme a bit better and feel like I have a clearer grasp on the overall tech stack and limitations.</p>
<p>Hugo is nice compared to mkdocs and the Python families of static website frameworks. Static vs dynamic can still be a blurry line with clever use of GitHub. Go&rsquo;s templating is interesting for other reasons. You probably still need to write a bit of HTML and JavaScript for anything custom, unfortunately. The Hugo shortcuts make this cleaner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly easy to fiddle with front-end elements and GUI considerations for hours without accomplishing anything meaningful.</p>
<p>Most of the things I think of and lean toward (re)inventing I come to find out already exist as mature OSS on GitHub. Still, some customization or additional work is needed to fit it to my needs.</p>

## me

Hello! My name is Cody (he/him). I'm passionate about progress via technology.

Currently a Technical Product Manager at [Voltron Data](https://voltrondata.com) focusing on data interfaces and awesome OSS like [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org).

Previously a Product Manager at [dbt Labs](https://getdbt.com) focusing on OSS (Python models) and Cloud (internal platform). Previously a Product Manager at [Azure ML (Microsoft)](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/machine-learning) focusing on data, MLOps, and v2 developer experiences.

See my [GitHub](https://github.com/lostmygithubaccount) and/or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/codydkdc) for more details on my experience.

I care about (in addition to product management, relevant to work stuff):

- OSS & scale
- beautiful design
- elegant engineering

## website

**This is my personal website. My views are separate from my (potential) employer's.**

The purpose of this website is to practice writing, coding, and documenting projects.

I&rsquo;ve had several drafts sitting around for even longer. To some extent, writing is easy &ndash; writing well and publishing is harder.</p>
<p>Every day, I open my reader application and read Matt Rickard&rsquo;s daily post. Some are good, some are great, some are amazing, and some are lackluster. But every day, without fail, something is posted. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s automated to some extent, and there&rsquo;s some backlog of pre-written articles to choose from. But why can&rsquo;t I even hit a tenth of the frequency? What&rsquo;s holding me back?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like New Years resolutions, but I did start the year wanting to write more myself on this website. Why haven&rsquo;t I?</p>
<p>I could give a lot of excuses &ndash; work got ridiculous, I wanted to code up some projects to write about and got stuck on them, I&rsquo;ve been busy with a new puppy, etc. etc. But then I had two months off and didn&rsquo;t publish a thing. I&rsquo;ve done stuff, including setting up and starting to edit a YouTube video (&ldquo;Coding with Cody&rdquo; begins???) but have failed to write here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know why. But let&rsquo;s consider this a start.</p>

## dbt Labs

Please feel free to reach out to me about dbt! It's part of my job.

I prefer GitHub or Slack, though there are other communication channels. Ensure you follow [the dbt Slack rules of the road](https://docs.getdbt.com/community/resources/slack-rules-of-the-road) and [expectations for OSS contributors](https://docs.getdbt.com/community/resources/oss-expectations).


Topics I'm particularly interested in:

- dbt Core (OSS)
    - non-SQL data modeling (Python)
    - scalability (tech and people)
    - repository setup and CI/CD
- dbt Runtime (coming soon!)
    - `dbt-server`
- data science, ML/AI with dbt

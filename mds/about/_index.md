## me

Hello! My name is Cody (he/him). I'm passionate about progress via technology.

Currently a Product Manager at [dbt Labs](https://getdbt.com) building delightful experiences for people, focusing on OSS and Cloud. Formerly a Product Manager at [Azure ML (Microsoft)](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/machine-learning) focusing on data, MLOps, and v2 developer experiences. See my [GitHub](https://github.com/lostmygithubaccount) and/or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/codydkdc) for more details on my experience.

I care about (in addition to product management):

- OSS & scale
- beautiful design
- elegant engineering

## why?

Having a website is cool. Hosting it on a custom domain name is cooler. Why dkdc.ai?

According to ChatGPT*:

> It's possible that someone might want the domain name "dkdc.ai" because it reflects a casual or relaxed attitude, and they feel that it would be a good fit for their personal or business brand. The phrase "don't know, don't care" (often abbreviated as "DKDC") is often used to express disinterest or apathy towards a particular subject or situation. It's possible that the owner of this domain name might want to convey a sense of ease or simplicity, or they might simply like the sound of the phrase.
>
> There are many potential reasons why someone might choose a specific domain name, and the ultimate decision will depend on the individual's goals and preferences. It's also possible that the owner of "dkdc.ai" simply liked the way the domain name sounded and thought it would be memorable and easy to spell.

According to me**:

> DKDC

I intend to use this website to:

- practice writing
- practice coding
- document projects

## what?

A website!

Goals:

- GitHub-powered commenting system
- works for reading and writing on mobile
- allows for posting content and media to RSS feeds

### secret roadmap

Use this website as motivation for learning some new languages and creating templates/tools for common automation. Document some past projects.

## how?
    
Source code: https://github.com/lostmygithubaccount/lostmygithubaccount.github.io.

Static website defined and built by Hugo using the PaperMod theme. Hosted on GitHub Pages as my user page. CI/CD by GitHub Actions. Custom domain used with a CNAME record.

## learnings

- GitHub pages are still a bit annoying
- I need to stop restarting from scratch
- I still really dislike front-end development

I'm basically back in the same place as my last website attempt with slightly less custom code and slightly faster build times. I do like the theme a bit better and feel like I have a clearer grasp on the overall tech stack and limitations. 

Hugo is nice compared to mkdocs and the Python families of static website frameworks. Static vs dynamic can still be a blurry line with clever use of GitHub. Go's templating is interesting for other reasons. You probably still need to write a bit of HTML and JavaScript for anything custom, unfortunately. The Hugo shortcuts make this cleaner.

It's incredibly easy to fiddle with front-end elements and GUI considerations for hours without accomplishing anything meaningful.

Most of the things I think of and lean toward (re)inventing I come to find out already exist as mature OSS on GitHub. Still, some customization or additional work is needed to fit it to my needs.

For months, I've had "write SOMETHING" in my GitHub project TODO list. I've had several drafts sitting around for even longer. To some extent, writing is easy -- writing well and publishing is harder.

Every day, I open my reader application and read Matt Rickard's daily post. Some are good, some are great, some are amazing, and some are lackluster. But every day, without fail, something is posted. I'm sure it's automated to some extent, and there's some backlog of pre-written articles to choose from. But why can't I even hit a tenth of the frequency? What's holding me back?

I don't like New Years resolutions, but I did start the year wanting to write more myself on this website. Why haven't I?

I could give a lot of excuses -- work got ridiculous, I wanted to code up some projects to write about and got stuck on them, I've been busy with a new puppy, etc. etc. But then I had two months off and didn't publish a thing. I've done stuff, including setting up and starting to edit a YouTube video ("Coding with Cody" begins???) but have failed to write here.

I don't really know why. But let's consider this a start.

Around five years ago, I drove with my dog Murphy and all the stuff I could fit in my '09 (?) honda civic from Houston, TX to Redmond, WA to start my career at Microsoft. This would complete (after a semester-long pause in Houston) the first of several drives between Florida and Washington state , one of my favorite activities. 5 years later, I've moved to Las Vegas, NV and doubled the amount of dogs (hi Nix!). 

## overview

But first, let's take one more step back -- why did I want to become a product manager? What was my background?

In my senior year of high school, I enjoyed chemistry and thought I wanted to major in chemical engineering. By the time I started at Rice University, I was less interested in this path and was instead deciding between computer science, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering. As the story goes, I found mechanical engineering a bit boring and ended up with electrical engineering due to an awesome course/professor my freshman year. A required computer science course being functional programming in Java was the final nail in the coffin. I dropped the course and my choice of major was solidified.

Oddly, 5 out of 30 electrical engineering majors in my class ended up at Microsoft. But before that, I had three internships:

1. Convergent Engineering: random coding and lots of learning
2. Texas Instruments: lots of coding and cool stuff
3. Convergent Engineering: building a device for hopsitals

## Convergent Engineering: Part I

- saltwater and electrodes in mouth
- reverse-engineering Chinese micro-ekg device
- data collection
- naive ML
- lots of learning

### what do I want next?

- chips! TI!

## Texas Instruments

- 3 projects
    - printf
    - benchmarking
    - DAG routing

### what do I want next?

- PM! ML! Microsoft!

## Convergent Engineering: Part II

- hopsital device
- other random stuff
- the very bad stuff :(

### what do I want next?

Still PM at Microsoft working in ML. Let's see...

## Microsoft (Azure ML)

- metrics pipeline
- data drift
- drifting in data
- learning and distributed data
- customer stuff?
- mlops stuff
- bunch of other stuff

## dbt Labs

- OSS
- cloud

## looking back

## looking forward

- voltron

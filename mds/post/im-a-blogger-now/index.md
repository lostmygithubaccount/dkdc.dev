Last year, I attempted to become a LinkedIn influencer. This year, I've decided to become a blogger. This is not my first attempt at a first post or website, there have been a few iterations. But I am committing to this one without restarting again. My goal is to post every week, though I'm already failing at that two weeks into the new year.

I'll focus my content on cool technology and open-source software contributions, however small.

## the beauty of OSS

Developing code (and related content) in the open has a number of benefits including:

- public, easily discoverable, and easily shareable
- competitive pressure to product quality work
- coalescing around common standards

dbt Labs calls this [contributing to the knowledge loop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/corp/blob/main/values.md#we-contribute-to-the-knowledge-loop), and it's certainly not a unique concept. Some other blogger [calls this the first magic](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-third-magic). I'll call this learning.

By developing in the open and leveraging public communities, we can build a better platform for ourselves and future people to build on. This is the beauty of OSS.

## inspiration and aspiration

There are clear inspirations. [Matthew Rocklin, creator of Dask, recently rethought his website and blog](https://matthewrocklin.com/redesign-blog.html) with some interesting points. I found [Tim Bray, a creator of XML, has an ongoing blog](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Tim) including [posts on Go written before I learned how to code](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2013/06/16/Go-Love-Hate) relevant for my own learning. While figuring out how to add the "last updated" field for this website, I found [a retired judge who told me exactly how, on a similar site using the same theme](https://www.jacksonlucky.net/posts/use-lastmod-with-papermod/).


Great content is out there. Great communities are out there. Over time they are usually gamified and the quality decreases. I've watched this trend unfold again on LinkedIn, which was and still is a source of useful content posted or amplified by a network of connected professionals -- but is increasingly memes and other noise.

This [website](/project/website) is my attempt to cut out noise and contribute learnings publicly.

## I'm a blogger now

Last year, I attempted to become a LinkedIn influencer. This year, I've decided to become a blogger. This is not my first attempt at a first post or website, there have been a few iterations. But I am committing to this one without restarting again. My goal is to post every week, though I'm already failing at that two weeks into the new year.

I'll focus my content on cool technology and open-source software contributions, however small.

## the beauty of OSS

Developing code (and related content) in the open has a number of benefits including:

- public, easily discoverable, and easily shareable
- competitive pressure to product quality work
- coalescing around common standards

dbt Labs calls this [contributing to the knowledge loop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/corp/blob/main/values.md#we-contribute-to-the-knowledge-loop), and it's certainly not a unique concept. Some other blogger [calls this the first magic](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-third-magic). I'll call this learning.

By developing in the open and levering public communities, we can build a better platform for ourselves and future people to build on. This is the beauty of OSS.

## inspiration and aspiration

I'm not calling this a blog because I like to be a contrarian -- this is just my website, and these are just my posts on it. I want to be intentional about what organization of content. Projects are high-effort, long-lived snapshots of something cool I did. Posts are low-effort, medium confidence knowledge sharing. Musings are high-effort, low-confidence knowledge sharing.

There are some clear inspirations. [Matthew Rocklin recently rethought his website and blog](https://matthewrocklin.com/redesign-blog.html) with some interesting points. I found out [Tim Bray, a creator of XML, has an ongoing blog](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing) including [posts on Go written before I larned how to code](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2013/06/16/Go-Love-Hate) I've found relevant for my own learning recently. While figuring out how to have the "last updated" field, I found [some random retired judge who told me exactly how with a similar site](https://www.jacksonlucky.net/posts/use-lastmod-with-papermod/).

Great content is out there. Great communities are out there. Unfortunately, over time they are usually gamified and the quality decreases. I've watched this trend unfold again on LinkedIn, which was and still is a source of useful content posted or amplified by a network of connected professionals -- but is increasingly memes and other noise. This website is my personal attempt to cut out noise without sacrificing.

It's as good a time as any to formalize my goal of writing publicly often.  

Last year I attempted to become a LinkedIn influencer. I gave up after about 5 posts. The quality of thought and writing on the social media platform was too much for me to match.

It was tedious to post on LinkedIn through the website or mobile app. I was tempted to automate posting them through APIs, authoring content in some other GUI. At that point, why not just make my own web app with less ads, gamification, and close association with my professional reputation? A personal website is great for that! 

I've had https://dkdc.ai for a few years and haven't done much with it. I've hosted previous iterations of this website, all pretty bad. I've learned multiple times that I strongly dislike web app development (even just static sites on GitHub Pages). I've tried to invent git-based Twitter before realizing it was a bad idea.

This time around, I'm coupling a writing goal to a technical goal. I'm going to use this website to practice writing and motivate cool public technical projects (outside of work) so that I can one day again pursue stardom on LinkedIn.

## strategy

My priority for this website is to post once per week.

The goals for those posts include:

- useful technical content
- interesting or amusing content
- documenting personal thoughts, opinions, processes, or projects relevant to tech

## why? what? when? who? where?

Those are all questions! I have a tendency of writing documents where I ask and answer questions and I don't think it usually comes off well to the reader.

It also leads to a lot of extra words. But the point is, the priority is to write publicly consistently to improve my writing. That implies the writing should be high quality and useful to readers, which it will likely not be. That goes back to why I'm posting on https://dkdc.ai -- I'm not expecting anybody to read it! This writing is mostly for myself, but I'm happy to share it with the world. I'm even happy to have you comment on it through GitHub.

Reading and writing are important skills that require practice. I have difficulty motivating myself for either, but especially writing outside of work. By coupling this to my website and prioritizing cool content -- cool tech stuff -- I hope to motivate the writing while learning about technology (outside of work) I'm interested in. 

### Parting thoughts

I like automating things and I know more about working with GitHub's REST and GraphQL APIs in Python and Go than billions of other people. I also like open-ended experiments -- trying out a new programming language, framework, or just dabbling in something I find interesting. Without a proper outlet for that (other than sloppily syncing code to GitHub), I can lack motivation to produce high-quality content outside of work. It's easier to write when you have a cool, working projects to write about.

I may also document some older projects, i.e. from internships or school. Beyond that, the quality of my posts will likely be very poor. I hope that the writing motivates the technical projects, and vice versa, improving both without needlessly optimizing either.

I want to keep the [web app](/projects/webiste) distinct from my goal of writing -- the web app separate from the content. There's a loose coupling in that I believe my best content will be technical content. However, experiments can fail without being worth writing about. Or I could just lack the time that week to produce something high-quality. Allowing myself to post about basically anything, as long as it's consistent, is the priority. 

The plan is to write posts about some technical projects -- mostly minor things -- once per week. The backup plan is to document projects I've already done, in a single place and format. Other backup plans include reviewing things or posting random personal opinions.

If I ever end up posting something titled "how I setup my RSS reader" you'll know I've started scraping from the bottom of the barrel, but also know there are at least 10 worse ideas.
